## ðŸ“¦ Port Automation Workflow

This repository contains a **personal** GitHub Actions workflow I use to automate ROM porting.
It was created due to rising hosting and development costs â€” so instead of running heavy processes locally, I offload them to GitHubâ€™s CI.

âš  **Disclaimer**

* This workflow is **for my own use only** and is not intended as a public service.
* Since the repo is public, youâ€™re welcome to look through the code for learning or inspiration, but I wonâ€™t be providing support or custom builds.
* Some steps may rely on private files, API tokens, or repositories â€” without these, the workflow wonâ€™t run successfully for others.

ðŸ’¡ **Why public then?**
Keeping it public helps with transparency, version control, and quick access across my devices. Itâ€™s **not** an open tool for general use.
